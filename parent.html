                <p>
                    The quality of a player’s hockey experience is determined by their
                    relationships with teammates, coaches, officials and parents.<br><br>
                    An openness between parents and the hockey community will create
                    an awareness and sensitivity to the problems and expectations of each.<br><br>
                    The hockey journey of your son/daughter is enhanced greatly by your
                    support and commitment.<br><br>
                    Parents have an enormous influence on players’ experiences.
                    Fortunately for most, parents are great sources of love, support and
                    encouragement.<br><br>
                    The secret of all enjoying our game lies in respecting each other when
                    there is a disagreement or a conflict. Expressing one’s feelings and
                    opinions in a respectful manner is a must.<br><br>
                    Parents of value regularly remind their sons and daughters that doing
                    ones best is more important than being the best.<br><br>
                    Our life in the hockey arena is to experience the game as part of the
                    total education that young people need to prepare for the future and
                    that there must be a balance between hockey and life.
